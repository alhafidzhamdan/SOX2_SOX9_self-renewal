# SOX2_SOX9_self-renewal
This repository contains all the scripts necessary to process the SOX2 and SOX9 chip-seq data on GBM stem cells. This is still currently a live repository with edits/updates implemented as the project evolves.

##### Step 1: Alignment to hg38 using BWA
##### Step 2: Filter and QC bam files
##### Step 3 (optional): Assessing reproducibility using IDR
##### Step 4 (optional): Assessing library complexity using phantompeak, deeptools plotFingerprint
##### Step 5: Calling peaks using MACS2
##### Step 6: Annotate genomic regions and genes using HOMER annotation
##### Step 7: Motif calling using HOMER (known motifs) and MEME-CHIP (de novo motifs).
##### Step 8: Consensus peak set (peak occupancy in 5 out 7)
##### Step 9: Visualisation using Deeptools suite of tools
